A **demo-level quadruped robot simulation** inspired by the Unitree Go2 Air, implemented entirely in **PyBullet**.
This project is NOT an official Unitree product, nor does it attempt to perfectly replicate Unitree's mechanical or control systems.
It is a **non-commercial educational demo** for robotics learning, simulation, and prototyping.

**NEW in Phase 3**: Autonomous navigation with ray-based obstacle detection and automatic jumping!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Gait Algorithm
- **Trot Pattern**: Diagonal leg pairs move together
  - FL (Front Left) + RR (Rear Right)
  - FR (Front Right) + RL (Rear Left)
- **Adaptive Frequency**: Gait speed adjusts with velocity
- **Swing Amplitude**: Proportional to forward speed

### Joint Control
- **Control Mode**: Position Control (PD controller)
- **Max Torque**: 30 Nm per joint
- **Joint Limits**: Defined in URDF for realistic motion

### Physics
- **Gravity**: 9.81 m/s²
- **Timestep**: 1/240 seconds
- **Ground Friction**: Environment-specific

### Autonomous Navigation (Phase 3)
- **Sensor System**: Ray casting in 4 directions
  - Forward ray: 2.0m detection range
  - Left/Right rays: 45° angles for side detection
  - Upward ray: 1.0m range for jump decision
- **Decision Algorithm**:
  - **Obstacle < 0.8m ahead**: Check if jumpable (low obstacle) or turn away (high obstacle)
  - **Side obstacle < 0.5m**: Turn away from closer side
  - **Path clear**: Continue forward
  - **Random exploration**: Occasional direction changes every 15 seconds
- **Jump Logic**: Triggers when obstacle is low enough (upward clearance > 0.4m)
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents rapid decision changes (0.5-2.0 seconds)

## Notes & Disclaimer
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance fully implemented!
- This is an educational demo, not a production-grade simulation.
- Does not replicate full physics/controls of real quadruped robots.
- Gait controller is simplified for demonstration purposes.
- For academic/commercial robotics: consider ROS2, Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, or Bullet Real-Time API.

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently! All Phase 1, 2 & 3 features are stable.
- Phase 4 features (LiDAR, SLAM, AI navigation) coming soon!
